# Sudoku Solver

## Description
  
    This is a React TypeScript app made to get a random sudoku pulled from an API and instantly solve it with one click.
    I got the idea for it when i was doing a Sudoku Validation problem on CodeWars and
    by the time i was finished i realized 'hey, this could be its own simple app'.
